                    Itâ€™s not always easy to filter out noise and purely focus on the content. Too many blogs and news sites are filled with colourful and distracting 
                    advertisement left right and centre. This is where we do things differently! Rather than just focusing purely and generating revenue, we focus 
                    on great user experience.   
                </p>
